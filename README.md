This calculator application is built using Python and Tkinter, a standard GUI toolkit for Python. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, the calculator also supports square and square root calculations.

The project showcases how to create a simple calculator using object-oriented programming and Tkinter's graphical elements.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Square and square root calculations
- Error handling for invalid expressions and division by zero
- Keyboard support for entering digits and operators

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
